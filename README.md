- 👋 Hello, my name is Umar! 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming; specifically finding innovative solutions to problems while also learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, although the accurate answer is; I am learning whatever language my most recent repositories consist of.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate on any project, although I am open to suggestions.
