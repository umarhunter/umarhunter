- 👋 Hello, my name is Umar! 
- 👀 I’m interested in programming; specifically creating interesting things for problems I encounter. Although, sometimes I make completely random projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, although the accurate answer is; I am learning whatever language my most recent repositories consist of.
- 💞 I love coffee ☕
- 💻 Currently not looking to collaborate on any projects.
